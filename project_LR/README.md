# Linear models

## About Dataset
Context
In the project we worked with a dataset on Housing Values in Suburbs of Boston in the 1970s and 80s built into the MASS package (Boston dataframe).

## Data analysis
 Under the project, I've built a full regression model to explore how the average cost of home-occupied houses depends on various variables  
 (average number of rooms, per capita crime rate by town, etc.). 
 Then Regression diagnostics was performed (testing the assumptions of linear regression). 
Finally, only the most influential predictors were kept and some recommendations for choosing a location to build a house were given.
